This is a project I made by following the tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ&t=28838s Lesson 7 of freeCodeCamp.org

First lottery contract made and functional : 0x1dD58E59de7Abca9be684B8BFE2eF1759B2AFAd9

. Users can enter lottery with ETH based on a USD fee
2. An admin will choose when the lottery is over
3. The lottery will select a random winner

How do we want to test this?
1. `mainnet-fork`
2. `development`with mocks
3. `testnet`
